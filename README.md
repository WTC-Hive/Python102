# Python Loops and Functions Project

Welcome to the Python Loops and Functions Project! In this project, you will practice working with **for/while loops, if/else statements, and functions** to solve challenging problems.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

1. **Fork the Repository**:  
   - Click the "Fork" button on the top right of this repository to create your own copy.

2. **Clone Your Fork**:  
   - Clone your forked repository to your local machine:  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Python102.git
     ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:  
   - Move into the project folder:  
     ```bash
     cd Python102
     ```

4. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:  
   - Create a virtual environment:  
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:  
     - On Windows:  
       ```bash
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On macOS/Linux:  
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```
   - Your terminal should now show the virtual environment name (e.g., `(venv)`).

5. **Install Dependencies**:  
   - Install the required packages:  
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

6. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment**:  
   - When you're done working, you can deactivate the virtual environment:  
     ```bash
     deactivate
     ```

### Step 2: Complete the Tasks

1. **Create a Branch**:  
   - Create a branch with your name (e.g., `lesego`):  
     ```bash
     git checkout -b YOUR_NAME
     ```

2. **Complete the Tasks**:  
   - Open `tasks.py` and implement the functions as described in the docstrings.  
   - Test your implementation using the provided unit tests.

3. **Run the Tests**:  
   - Run the tests and make sure they all pass:  
     ```bash
     pytest test_tasks.py
     ```
   - Passing test cases will appear like this:

4. **Commit and Push Your Changes**:  
   - Add your changes:  
     ```bash
     git add tasks.py
     ```
   - Commit your changes:  
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Completed tasks"
     ```
   - Push your changes to your branch:  
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

5. **Submit a Pull Request**:  
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click "New Pull Request".  
   - Select your branch (`YOUR_NAME`) and submit the pull request to the main repository.
